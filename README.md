# Shark Attack Data
Using Machine Learning to help educate the public and save the shark population

# Global Interactive Map
 **View interactive map [here](https://janaeam.github.io/global-shark-attacks-and-map/)**

> Click on the numbered icons in the area of your choice. The number on the icons represents the amount of attacks for that area/country. Continue clicking on the icon
until a blue circle or many blue circles appear. Each blue circle represents an individual shark attack. A popup will appear with the **COUNTRY** that the attack took 
place in, the **ACTIVITY** the person was engaged in before the attack ocurred and whether or not the attack was **FATAL**.

*Data is current as of Jul 26, 2021*


# Data Wrangling
(complete description of data cleaning processes are explained in detail in the [ipynb file](https://github.com/janaeam/global-shark-attacks-and-map/blob/main/Shark_Attack_Data.ipynb))

## Challenges:
* The original datset included dates as far back as 1010 BC.
* The Dates were inconsistently listed.
* Many of the dates were complete, however, there were also many that contained only the year or vague timing (i.e. "circa", "before", "between", etc).
* An abundant of spelling errors were present in almost every column.
* The activities column had many different names for similar activities as well as a lot of spelling errors.
* Effort was spent sorting, interpreting, categorizing and simplifying the listed activities.
* The location of shark attacks were not always listed by city or the beach in which they occured.
* Substantial effort went into organizing attacks by Country.
* Further effort in the futue will be spent on pinpointing the specific locations where possible.

## Outcomes:
* Clustering techniques were attempted in an effort to find commonalities in location or possibly activities being performed before the attack occured.
* Graphs and Visualizations show where the highest number of attacks take place and where the attacks result in the most fatalities.
* Further analysis is needed as data continues to be cleaned and interpreted.

## Importance:
*  Education for the public is necessary as we learn more about shark behaviors and habits.
* Education is vital for the future and survival of shark populations.
